# Faculty-Event-Control

At general, we need to keep track of event data in colleges, which is typically done manually. So, in this case, our Faculty Event Control comes into play, allowing us to keep track of every single event, from the date of organisation to the start and end times. We may also use this system to plan new events, including all relevant details such as the Event Co-ordinator, the location where the event will be held, the event's start time, and the event's end time. This technique also aids in the keeping of attendance records.
